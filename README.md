Google Homepage project - as part of The Odin Project

In this project, I wrote in HTML and CSS, following the project brief in The Odin Project (TOP). One major difference in my code versus what I've seen in TOP is that I opted to use HTML5 semantic elements (header, nav, main, etc) and style those in CSS rather than relying on multiple divs and other non-semantic elements (e.g. span) From my reading (MDN docs), this is now considered best practice as semantic elements give more meaning to each section, are easier to read, and are easier to maintain.

I also used MDN docs as my primary resource in first learning HTML and CSS as I found it more useful to write code locally with VS Code and the LiveServer extension, rather than in the browser. I could then play around with the entire code, create multiple examples, etc. without having to click through lessons.

I did end up doing a bit more than the brief in order to learn more skills, so my Google homepage includes links and other slightly more intensive CSS things like hover shadows, etc. Having to adapt to the HTML5 also played a part in that as I needed to figure out how to call to the correct element and what I could do with it. 

My goal was to avoid redundancy in my code while also making it readable. The one bit of redundancy I decided to keep was the nav tags; even though I didn't call on them in the CSS and could easily remove them, I decided to keep them again for the purpose of readability and specificity.
